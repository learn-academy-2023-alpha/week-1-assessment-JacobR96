// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
// const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil", "indigo"]
// b) Verify and explain:

// --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer:10
// b) Verify and explain:The Anwser is 10 since its a string everything in the "" will be counted including the spaces. And the count will start at 1 becuse its a string not an array

// --------------------2) What will this log?

// const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: o
// b) Verify and explain: the [] searches for the index of that number in side the string 

// --------------------3) What will this log?

// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer:ruby
// b) Verify and explain: Ruby was the result , it go that number because index had a value of 1 , and when languages was called it search the array for the index of (1)

// --------------------4) What will this log?

// const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer:I don't beleive this will work because toUppercase is for a string not an Array

// b) Verify and explain: this method is only for string.

// // --------------------5) What will this log?

// const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// // a) Your answer:so if you take out the type of this would log [4]but becuase type of is not called anywhere and is undefined this will not work.
// // b) Verify and explain: (type of) was undefined
